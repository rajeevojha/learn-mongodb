# MongoDB Hands-On Practice

This repository contains hands-on experiments with MongoDB covering core concepts such as replica sets, sharding, aggregation pipelines, backups, security, and admin tasks. This will support architect-level discussions and practical demonstrations.

## Structure
- `replica-set/`: Setup and failover simulation
- `sharding/`: Data partitioning with shard keys
- `aggregation-pipeline/`: Complex queries and data analysis
- `security/`: Authentication, authorization, and SSL
- `backups-and-recovery/`: Point-in-time recovery and automated dumps
- `dba-ops/`: User management, indexing, performance tuning
- `terraform/`: Infra provisioning scripts on AWS

All scripts and notes are tailored for use from a WSL environment.
